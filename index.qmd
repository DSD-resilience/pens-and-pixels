I help people understand and use data models.  Some of my favorite subjects to write about include data, technology and human affairs. 

One effective structure for online content is provide an overview of the problem, then contrast it with the perfect endstate or a positive vision of the future.  Finally, provide a step-by-step solution that gets your reader from the problem to the endstate.
