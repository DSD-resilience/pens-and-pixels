# **What is Complexity? Well, It Is Not Complicated.**

## While “complex” and “complicated” are often used interchangeably, the differences can have profound implications for your life.

In a world filled with challenges, knowing the difference between what is “complicated” and what is “complex” can be the key to solving problems more effectively. While the two words are often used interchangeably, they describe very different realities. As you approach dilemmas, you want to use the correct models to solve them. If you can define what you face as either “complicated” or “complex” then that is a positive step towards defining the problem as a whole.

Complicated systems — like a software program— may be intricate but can be broken down, analyzed, repaired and improved. Complex systems — like climate patterns or human relationships — are dynamic, with several factors and unpredictable outcomes. Recognizing whether you’re dealing with a complicated task or a complex situation can shape your thinking. This recognition alerts to as to whether you need a manual (“complicated”), or a mindset (“complex”) that is ready to adapt and evolve.

# **Complicated**

-   **Can be hard to understand**, but it *can* be figured out with enough effort.

-   Usually has **many parts**, but those parts interact in **predictable** ways.

-   Think of a **car engine**: lots of components, but mechanics can take it apart and put it back together because it follows a clear structure.

-   Complicated systems can be good for a business because they take effort to replicate and can be routinely repaired with the proper analysis. Simply be careful when considering cost vs. benefit.

# **Complex**

-   Involves **many factors that interact in unpredictable or changing ways**.

-   **Can’t always be fully understood or controlled**, even with lots of information. Family situations are often characterized as this.

-   Think of a **rainforest ecosystem** or the **stock market**: small changes can lead to big, unexpected outcomes. Leverage also counts for a lot. Since inputs do not always equal outputs, you may want to play a complex game for higher returns on your effort. Naval Ravikant has great [advice](https://www.navalmanack.com/) on leverage, and playing games in general. Nassim Taleb understands [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)), but be warned that his writing takes several reads to really sink in.

# **More Practical Examples**

Let’s take a look across three familiar domains — technology, biology, and human behavior — to explore this distinction.

## **Technology: Building vs. Managing**

Constructing a smartphone is a *complicated* task. It involves assembling thousands of components with precision. But there’s a blueprint, and with the right tools and expertise, the process is manageable and repeatable.

Contrast that with running a social media platform. This is *complex*. User behavior, algorithm design, viral content, and misinformation all interact in unpredictable ways. What works one day may backfire the next, and no single fix can guarantee success. It’s a system in constant flux, requiring adaptation and learning rather than strict control.

## **Biology: Structures vs. Systems**

The human skeletal system is an example of a *complicated* biological structure. It can be mapped, understood, and repaired using established knowledge and tools.

The immune system, however, is *complex*. It doesn’t just respond to threats in a linear fashion — it adapts, remembers, and sometimes misfires. Interactions with diet, stress, pathogens, and genetics create a living system that’s difficult to predict and even harder to fully master.

## **Human Behavior: Tasks vs. Relationships**

Filing your taxes may be a pain, but it’s *complicated*, not complex. The forms and rules are detailed, but with enough effort — or a good accountant — you can get through it.

Raising a teenager, on the other hand, is *complex*. Emotions, peer influence, development stages, and communication all mix in unique ways for each child. There’s no manual, and what works one day might fail the next. It’s an evolving relationship that demands empathy, flexibility, and patience.

# **Final Thoughts**

Recognizing whether you’re facing a complicated or complex challenge is more than a semantic exercise — it can help you choose the right strategy. When things are complicated, bring in experts, follow instructions, and rely on logic. When they’re complex, step back, observe patterns, and be ready to adapt. Knowing the difference just might change the way you solve problems forever.
