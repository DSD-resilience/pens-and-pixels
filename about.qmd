👋 Hi, I’m JT, from DSD. We help people understand and use data models.

👀 Key areas of research and development are statistics, AI-ML, and cyber resiliency.

![](images/clipboard-1789841209.png){width="20"} I write regular features on [Medium](https://datascientistdude.medium.com/) and [Substack](https://substack.com/@datascientistdude?utm_source=user-menu).

🌱 Let's help you find more and better ways to analyze data with R, Python and SQL.

💞️ Your clients can benefit from our collaborations on machine learning applied for strategic insights, statistical analysis and data cleaning.

📫 Let's communicate: [millerauthor\@datascientistdude.com](mailto:millerauthor@datascientistdude.com) for business inquiries please.

😄 Dad Joke of the Day: One day I gave up my seat on public transportation for a blind lady. And that is how I lost my job as a bus driver.
